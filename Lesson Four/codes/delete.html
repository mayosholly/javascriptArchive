<!-- Example 1: In this example, the salary property exists in the emp object, the delete operation is successful, and true is logged to the console.

 -->

 <script>
    let emp = { 
	firstName: "Raj", 
	lastName: "Kumar", 
	salary: 40000 
} 

console.log(delete emp.salary);
console.log(emp);

 </script>

 <!-- Example 2: In this example, delete person.phone returns true and logging the person object shows that the phone property doesn’t exist anymore.

 -->

 <script>
    let person = {
	firstName: "John",
	lastName: "Doe",
	phone: 12345
}

console.log(delete person.phone);
console.log(person);

 </script>]


<!-- Example 3: In this example, delete operator doesn’t work for variables or function, it returns false and the actual variables and functions remain untouched.

 -->

 <script>
    let num = 5; 
let sum = (a, b) => { 
	return a + b; 
} 

console.log(delete num); //false 
console.log(delete sum); //false

 </script>

 <!-- let num = 5; 
let sum = (a, b) => { 
	return a + b; 
} 

console.log(delete num); //false 
console.log(delete sum); //false
 -->

 <script>
    toDelete = 5;

// true
console.log(delete toDelete);

// toDelete is not defined
console.log(toDelete);

 </script>

 <!-- Example 5: In this example, we are deleting Array Values Using delete

 -->

 <script>
    let arr = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(delete arr[0]); //true
console.log(arr); //[empty, 2, 3]

 </script>
