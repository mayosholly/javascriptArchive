JavaScript Arrays
JavaScript Array is a single variable that is used to store elements of different data types. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed. Javascript Arrays are not associative in nature.

Declaration of an Array
There are basically two ways to declare an array.

1. Creating an array using array literal:
let arrayName = [value1, value2, ...];

2. Creating an array using the JavaScript new keyword:
let arrayName = new Array();

Accessing Elements of an Array
Any element in the array can be accessed using the index number. The index in the arrays starts with 0.

Difference between Javascript arrays and objects
Javascript arrays use indexes as numbers
objects use indexes as names.
When to use JavaScript Arrays and Objects?
Arrays are used when we want element names to be numeric.
Objects are used when we want element names to be strings.
JavaScript new Array() :
JavaScript has a built-in array constructor new Array().
[] can also be used.
These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:

const points = new Array();
const points = [];
Recognizing a JavaScript Array
There are two methods by which we can recognize a JavaScript array:

By using Array.isArray() method
By using instanceof method
