<!-- Example 1: This example illustrates the single-line comment.  -->
<script>
    // A single line comment 
console.log("Hello Geeks!");

</script>


<!-- Example 2: In this example, we will assign values to some variables and explain them with single-line comments. -->

<script>
    // Declaring a variable and assign value to it
let geek = 'Computer science portal';
console.log(geek)

// Perform operation of addition of two numbers
let sum = 5 + 8
console.log(sum)

</script>

<!-- Example: This example illustrates the multi-line comment using /* â€¦ */ 

 -->

 <script>
    /* It is multi line comment. 
It will not be displayed upon 
execution of this code */

console.log("Multiline comment in javascript");

 </script>


<!-- Example 1: JavaScript comments are used to prevent execution of selected code to locate problems of code or while testing new features. This example illustrates that commented code will never execute.  -->

<script>
    function add() {
	let x = 10;
	let y = 20;
	let z = x + y;
	// console.log(x + y);
	console.log(z);
}

add();

</script>


<!-- Example 2: This example uses multi-line comments to prevent the execution of addition code and perform subtraction operations. -->

<script>
    function sub() {
	let x = 10;
	let y = 20;
	/* let z = x + y;
	console.log(z); */

	let z = x - y;
	console.log(z);
}

sub();
