<!-- Example: Below is an example of Objects in JavaScript.

 -->

 <script>
    const o = new Object();
o.foo = 42;

console.log(o);
// { foo: 42 }


// Example: In this example “name”, “location”, and “established” are all “keys” and “Vivekananda School”, “Delhi” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively. Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object. An object in JavaScript may also have a function as a member, in which case it will be known as a method of that object. Here  “displayinfo” is a method of the school object that is being used to work with the object’s data, stored in its properties.

// JavaScript code demonstrating a simple object
let school = {
	name: 'Vivekananda School',
	location: 'Delhi',
	established: '1971',
	displayInfo: function () {
		console.log(`${school.name} was established 
			in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`);
	}
}
school.displayInfo(); 

 </script>

<!-- Example: Below is the example of object properties. -->

<script>
    let school = {
	name: 'Vivekananda School',
	location: 'Delhi',
	established: '1971',
	20: 1000,
	displayInfo: function () {
		console.log(`The value of the key 20 is ${school['20']}`);
	}
}
school.displayInfo(); 

</script>

<!-- Example: In this example, we are accessing ‘Vivekananda’ from ‘Vivekananda School’.

 -->

 <script>
    // Bracket notation 
let school = {
	name: 'Vivekananda School',
	displayInfo: function () {
		console.log(`${school.name.split(' ')[0]}`);
	}
}
school.displayInfo(); // Vivekananda

 </script>

 <!-- Example: Below is the example of inherited properties.

 -->

 <script>
    // hasOwnProperty code in js
const object1 = new Object();
object1.property1 = 42;

console.log(object1.hasOwnProperty('property1')); // true

 </script>


<!-- Example: Below is the example of accessing object members.

 -->

 <script>
    let school = { 
	name : "Vivekanada", 
	location : "Delhi", 
	established : 1971,
	20 : 1000, 
	displayinfo : function() { 
		console.log(`${school.name} was established 
		in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`); 
	} 

} 
console.log(school.name); 

console.log(school.established);

 </script>


<!-- Example: Below is the example of Bracket Notation.

 -->

 <script>
    let school = {
	name: "Vivekanada School",
	location: "Delhi",
	established: 1995,
	20: 1000,
	displayinfo: function () {
		document.write(`${school.name} was established 
		in ${school.established} at ${school.location}`);
	}
}

// Output : Vivekanada School 
console.log(school['name']);

// Output: 1000 
console.log(school['20']); 

 </script>

 <!-- Iterating over all keys of an object
 -->

 <script>
    let person = {
	gender: "male"
}

let person1 = Object.create(person);
person1.name = "Adam";
person1.age = 45;
person1.nationality = "Australian";

for (let key in person1) {
	// Output : name, age, nationality 
	// and gender
	console.log(key);
}		 

 </script>

 <!-- Example: Below is the example of deleting properties.

 -->
 <script>
    let obj1 = { 
	propfirst : "Name"
} 

// Output : Name 
console.log(obj1.propfirst); 
delete obj1.propfirst 

// Output : undefined 
console.log(obj1.propfirst);			 

 </script>

 <!-- Example: In this example, we can not delete inherited properties or non-configurable properties

 -->

 <script>
    let obj1 = { 
	propfirst : "Name"
} 
// Output : Name 
console.log(obj1.propfirst) 
let obj2 = Object.create(obj1); 

// Output : Name 
console.log(obj2.propfirst); 
	
// Output : true. 
console.log(delete obj2.propfirst); 

	// Surprisingly Note that this will return true 
	// regardless of whether the deletion was successful 

	// Output : Name	 
	console.log(obj2.propfirst); 

 </script>
