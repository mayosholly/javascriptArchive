JavaScript For Loop
Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions repeatedly until some condition evaluates and becomes false. We come across for loop which provides a brief and systematic way of writing the loop structure.

JavaScript for loop is used to iterate the elements for a fixed number of times. JavaScript for loop is used if the number of the iteration is known.

Syntax
