JavaScript for-in Loop
JavaScript for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object. JavaScript for-in loop iterates only over those keys of an object which have their enumerable property set to “true”.

The key values in an object have four attributes (value, writable, enumerable, and configurable).

It can be a great debugging tool if we want to show the contents of an object.
Important Points
Use the for-in loop to iterate over non-array objects. Even though we can use a for-in loop for an array, it is generally not recommended. Instead, use a for loop for looping over an array.
The properties iterated with the for-in loop also include the properties of the objects higher in the Prototype chain.
The order in which properties are iterated may not match the properties that are defined in the object.

Here in the above example what happened is:

JavaScript for-in loop iterates on the object of the course.
The for every iteration, a key is returned (item)
The item can now be used to access the value of the object
The value of the key is given by courses[item]
