JavaScript Let
JavaScript let is a keyword used to declare variables that are block-scoped. Variables defined with the let keyword cannot be redeclared and must be declared before use.

let keyword was added in the ES6 or ES2015 version of JavaScript. Generally, it is suggested that we use the let keyword while working with JavaScript.

Syntax:
let variable_name = value;
Block Scope
The variables which are declared inside the { } block are known as block-scoped variables. variables declared by the var keyword cannot be block-scoped.


Global Scope
A global scope variable is a variable declared in the main body of the source code, outside all functions.

Function Scope
A function scope variable is a variable declared inside a function and cannot be accessed outside the function.

Redeclaring Variables in different blocks
The variables declared using let can be redeclared inside other blocks.

Redeclaring Variables in the same blocks
We cannot redeclare variables using the let keyword inside the same blocks. It will throw an error.
