Difference between Methods and Functions in JavaScript
JavaScript Functions
A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks. We can define a function using the function keyword, followed by Name and optional parameters. The body of the function is enclosed in Curly braces.

Syntax: 
function functionName(parameters) {
    // Content
}
Features:
The function is executed when something calls/invokes it.
The name may contain letters, digits, dollar signs, and underscore.
Parameters are listed inside round parenthesis after the name of the function.
Arguments are values a function receives when it is invoked.
When the control reaches the return statement, js will stop executing and the value is returned to the caller.

JavaScript Methods
A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties. Object method can be accessed with the following syntax:

Syntax:
object = {
    methodName: function() {
        // Content
    }
};
object.methodName()
Features:
Actions that can be performed on objects are what we term JavaScript methods.
The objects can also be called without using parenthesis.
This refers to the owner object in a method.
